# Some comments about the AVCN

It's supposed that the output frequency of each filter should be similar to its mid. frequency.

Each filter has a band range, so it will response to different frequencies.

The results show the output frequency of each filter is similar to the frequency of the input sound.

It would be nice to compare the resources needed for obtaining the phase-locked spikes with a signed cochlea instead of normal cochlea. In our case, it's easier to generate the phase-locked spikes just by detecting the zero-crossing.

The phase-locked spikes cannot be used for sound classification due to for that task we need both the frequency and the volume of the sound.
