# Thinks that can be improved

1. Detection time associated to each frequency channel sould be related to the middel frequency of the channel's bandpass filter. This way, instead of to have a time bin of 700 for every channel, lower frequency channels will have longer time bin, and higher frequency channels will have shorter time bin.

2. Delay time shouldn't be the same for all the cases, since the time that the sounds needs to reach each ear is different according to the position. It should be calculated using the hipotenuse of the triangle.
